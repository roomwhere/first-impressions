## The Room Where It Happens

You're wondering what "It" is. The Room Where It Happens was borne out of a desire to publicize conversations that make us think, and make us laugh. Conversations that are current, and all too often only available to a chosen few.

While inspired by, "The Room Where It Happens" is in no way, shape, or form, affiliated with the hit Broadway Musical, Hamilton.
